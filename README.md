# RemoteSwitch
iOS simple app to control a WiFi-enabled relay over UDP

The app sends the string value "0" to turn the relay off and the string "1" to turn it on.

It only supports a single remote relay. A relay name, its IP address, UDP port number and initial state are configurable and preserved in AppStorage.
